# Abstractive Text Summarization for Urdu

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an NLP application that performs abstractive text summarization for Urdu language content using the mT5 (Multilingual Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) model. Abstractive text summarization involves generating a concise summary by interpreting and rephrasing the most important information from the source text, rather than simply extracting sentences.
